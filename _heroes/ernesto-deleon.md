Ernesto “Audie” DeLeon, 61 years old, was an ADN at Bellevue Hospital, where he worked for over 30 years. On April 13, 2020, DeLeon lost his 13 day battle with COVID-19. A [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/in-loving-memory-of-ernesto-deleon) has been set up in his memory and to support his family.

Audie's colleague Claire Martinez shared these memories: “During his tenure, he was an incredible inspiration and a mentor to hundreds of nurses, doctors and other clinical staff. He was an immensely kind soul with a humble demeanor. He will always be dearly loved by his friends who have become family, his coworkers, and relatives.”

Ernesto's colleagues at Bellevue Hospital held a service in his honor, and [posted a portion of the remembrance on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=sSp0_py5Twk&app=desktop).
