Alex Bass, a physician assistant who worked at Coney Island Hospital for 22 years, died on April 10 from coronavirus-related complications. He was 52 years old.

A beloved family man and respected healthcare worker, Bass moved from his home in Ukraine to Brooklyn in 1993. He attended Hunter College as an undergraduate and received his medical training from Touro College before working in the urology department at Coney Island Hospital, where his sense of humor and generosity won over coworkers and patients.
